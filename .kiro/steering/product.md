# Product Overview

SovSeal (Sovereign Seal) is an institutional-grade Zero-Knowledge Media Vault — a decentralized protocol for digital legacy and time-locked media using client-side encryption, IPFS storage, and Polkadot blockchain.

## Brand Identity

**Name**: SovSeal (Sovereign Seal) — Short, authoritative, implies only the user has power to "break the seal."

**Tagline**: "The Sovereign Protocol for Digital Legacy" | "Unbreakable Verification of Truth and Intent"

## Core Value Proposition

We don't sell "messages." We sell **Admissibility**, **Security**, and **Finality**. We are the bridge between a person's intent today and its execution 50 years from now.

**"Guaranteed by math, not corporations"** - Privacy and unlock conditions are enforced by cryptography and blockchain consensus, not trusted third parties.

## Target Personas

1. **The Estate Planner** (HNW Individual) - Secure, legally-admissible digital will supplement
2. **The Whistleblower** (Journalist/Activist) - Dead man's switch with automated release
3. **The Legal Professional** (Lawyer/Notary) - Timestamped, tamper-proof evidence
